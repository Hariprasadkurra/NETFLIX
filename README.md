# 📊 Netflix Content Analysis & Clustering

## 📝 Project Overview
This project involves exploratory data analysis (EDA) and unsupervised machine learning techniques on the Netflix content dataset. The goal is to understand trends, insights, and patterns in the data and then use text-based clustering to group similar content based on descriptions.

## 📌 Objectives
Perform detailed EDA to uncover content distribution patterns across countries, genres, release years, and content types.

Clean and preprocess textual data (e.g., descriptions).

Engineer meaningful features to enhance analysis and modeling.

Apply TF-IDF vectorization and KMeans Clustering to segment content based on description similarity.

Compare clustering results with Agglomerative Clustering.

Use hyperparameter tuning to improve cluster quality.

## 📂 Dataset
Source: Netflix dataset (typically from Kaggle or other public sources)

Fields used: title, type, country, release_year, description, rating, listed_in, etc.

Total Rows: ~6,800+

Missing Values: Handled through imputation or exclusion based on context.

## 🧠 Conclusion
This project effectively combined data exploration and unsupervised learning to extract meaningful insights from the Netflix dataset. Through clustering based on descriptions, we discovered hidden groupings in content that go beyond surface-level metadata. The project highlights the power of combining EDA with ML techniques for deeper content intelligence.
